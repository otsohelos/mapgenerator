# Software requirements specification
**MapGenerator by Otso Helos**
## Introduction
### Purpose
MapGenerator is a tool for creating randomized maps with realistic features such as elevation, terrain type, and features such as rivers and other bodies of water.

MapGenerator is my work for the course "Aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂: Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit" as part of my Bachelor's in Computer Science, University of Helsinki, spring 2023.

###Intended Audience
MapGenerator is intended for roleplayers, speculative fiction authors, and people who just like looking at nice maps.

### Intended Use
MapGenerator is intended for fun and inspiration. It is meant to produce believable maps of fictional areas the size of continents or large groups of islands.

## Overall Description

### User Needs
The user will use MapGenerator to define some variables for the map, generate a map, and then save the map wither as a picture or possibly a file that can be edited in MapGenerator in the future.
#### Choosing Variables
The user will be able to just generate a map without choosing any variables, as there will be a preset that produces a nice map. If the user wants to, they can choose several variables, including
* Size of the map
* Varibility in elevation
* Moisture levels

#### Generating A Map
After choosing the variables, the user will be able to generate a map. If the result isn't satisfactory, they can choose to generate another one with the same variables. As randomness is used, each repetition will produce a different map.

#### Saving A Map
The interface will allow for saving the map as an image file on the user's computer. If maps are made editable in later iterations of the software, there will also be a possiblity to save a file that can be uploaded back to MapGenerator and edited.

### Technical Specification
#### Languages And Frameworks
MapGenerator will use a Java backend and a React.js frontend.
