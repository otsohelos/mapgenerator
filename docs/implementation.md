# Implementation documentation

## Structure of the program

Backend is done in Java 17/Spring and uses Maven 3.9.1. Frontend is done in React.

## Time requirements

Current time for generating Voronoi diagram has been measured as under 10 ms.

## Considerations for future development

A Lloyd relaxation would be a logical future step.
